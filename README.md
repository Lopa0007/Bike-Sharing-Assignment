## General Information
 - US based company BoomBikes is trying to revive their business in post-covid era by understanding the bike rental demand with respect to different driving factors. Once such factors are identified, these will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features so that They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the customer's expectations along with the target demand levels. The analysis is done on historical data of daily bike demands across the American market.

## Conclusions
- It has been observed that the most important driving factors behind number bike rentals are daily temperature and windspeed. Intuitively, when the temparatue increases, more people tend to use bike. On the other hand, if the windspeed is more, there has been decrease in no of rentals. Although, the year also looks like a promising factor which implies that with coming year the demand in bike rentals gets increased, but the dataset contains only data of year 2018 and 2019, more recent should be analysed to know current trend.
